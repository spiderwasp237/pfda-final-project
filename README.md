## Description
This project is a recreation of the classic game "Pong". Two players bounce a ball back and forth using paddles until one player reaches 7 points. I created two classes to make the code more readable and function better. The Striker Class represents a paddle controlled by a player. It handles the paddle's position, dimensions, speed, and color, as well as rendering and updating the paddle on the screen. The Ball Class represents the ball in the game. It manages the ball's position, radius, speed, and color, as well as rendering and updating the ball's movement and collisions. In the future, I might try to have the ball increase with each volley between the players. I attempted to do this before the due date, but it wasn't working as intended so I cut it.
